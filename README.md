# JD_website

## Description
This is a quick website I made for myself over the course of ~24 hours (and some change) to 1. highlight some of the work I do and 2. learn how to make websites! :) I did a lot of reverse engineering of websites I thought looked cool as well as checking out some cool [github repos](https://github.com/arscan/encom-globe/blob/master/index.html) to use for this project.
